##### Prerequisities

- [Follow the Platform Repository Readme Steps](https://github.com/raphael-app/platform.git)

##### How to use ? 

Raphael backed application aims to providing custom rest APIs, authorized&authenticated with oAuth2, to its clients. For a simple flow, you need to obtain an access_token first, then you can just send requests to fetch datas.

##### Create an application

After you logging as a super-user, you need to browse "http://localhost:8000/o/applications/" then click on the link to create a new application and fill the form with the following data:

```
Name: just a name of your choice
Client Type: confidential
Authorization Grant Type: Resource owner password-based
```

##### Obtaining an Access-Token

Before getting the permission-required datas from Raphael, you need to obtain an acceess-token with your client credentials. And to obtain an Access-token, you need to send below request to raphael;

```
curl -X POST -d "grant_type=password&username=<user_name>&password=<password>" -u"<client_id>:<client_secret>" http://localhost:8000/o/token/
````

That will generate an output as below;

```
{"access_token": "VEVh9pvn791eeG34uEutlrmZGlODXw", "expires_in": 36000, "token_type": "Bearer", "scope": "read write groups", "refresh_token": "3xrf6H4nDsmPTyPCbWjNiMNRwlwRR8"}
```

And copy the access-token.

##### Fetching the DATAs!

Okay, now you are ready to use Raphaels custom APIs freely! with your access-token.

```
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer VEVh9pvn791eeG34uEutlrmZGlODXw" http://localhost:8000/restaurants/
```
